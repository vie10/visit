I’m an Idealist person who targets high level in the things works with. I love programming – no limits, you can be better always. I got a lot of knowledges while working with different peoples from all the world on open-source projects and not only. I always open to new mets and experience exchanges. I love to study things that I can use in practice. Also I'm a stubborn person. Therefore all the things I starts should be finished. I never drop something before try a lot of different ways and ideas. I like improve things i can. I prefer practice to theory — not without but not only. Active, cheerful and motivated to engage time with a team for joint achievements. I’ve started programming in Java and switch to Kotlin later.
