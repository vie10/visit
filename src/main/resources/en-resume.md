I’m a passionate programmer and an idealist who is always willing to learn new things. I'm not affrain of challenges.
I've learned a lot by working with people all around the globe on projects radically different. I love to experience new
things and meet new people. What I prefer above all is to put into practice what I learn. Also, I'm a stubborn person
which means that I am eager to finish the projects I start. I never drop something before trying a lot of different ways
and ideas to make it. I like improve things I can. I prefer practice to theory — not without but not only. Active,
cheerful and motivated to engage time with a team for joint achievements. I started programming in Java then moved to
Kotlin.

#### Experience

**Freelance since 03.2022**

I'm experienced with independent projects in various languages such as Kotlin (JS,JVM), Java.

I've worked for a few server projects, and it made me learn so much about Ktor, Ktorm, Hoplite, Kotlinx Coroutines,
Koin, KodeIn, Mockk, Kotest, etc. Including the next tools for work in team and efficiency cooperate: GitHub (workflows
as well), Gradle.

In this time have got experience with Kotlin/JS web application development with React and MUI in the box.

**Looks like a good place for your company**

Doesn't it sound like an appeal?
